          <h1>Pre-Departure Meet</h1>
          <p>
            Congratulations! If you have reached this stage it means you are about to dive into an extraordinary new
            experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we realize that it can an overwhelming feeling, trust us, the best is yet to come. We are all here
            to help you
            on this journey. To assist you with planning for life in your new nation, we have various pre-departure
            meetings with
            students and parents consistently before each country intake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Attend our PreDepartures, and youâ€™ll see your apprehension vanish into thin air. Our PreDeparture session
            will assist you with exploring individual and social development openings while you are abroad. We help you
            with a prepared flowchart to follow before leaving India.
          </p>
          <p>In this session, we will guide you about migration checks, customs controls, and how to reach your campus
            from the airport most conveniently. We will also brief you on the rules and regulations of your chosen
            country and what rights you have as an international student.</p>
          <p>Most importantly, however, you will get to meet other Envision students from around India who are going
            to the same place as you. Some of the friendships formed at this event last lifetimes. Be sure not to miss
            it!
